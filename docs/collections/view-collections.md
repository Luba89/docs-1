This section describes in detail the features available in the GDN console and how to work with your collections in the Macrometa console.

## View Your Collections

Once you log in to a Macrometa account, you can view all collections that you have access to.

1. Log in to Macrometa.
1. Click **Collections**.

Macrometa dispays a list of collections. The following columns show information about each collection.

### Collection Name

The list of all collections you have access to, sorted alphabetically.

### Data Model

Displays the type of each collection.

### Stream Enabled

Shows whether a collection stream is enabled (Yes) or not enabled (No). You can change this in the collection Data tab.

### Distribution

When a collection is created, it can be locally or globally distributed across Macrometa servers. This section displays the distribution type for your collections - Local or Global.

## Filter Collections

If you have many collections, then it can be helpful to filter your collection list so that you have fewer to sort through.

You can filter collections by _name_ or by _type_.

### Filter Collections by Name

To filter collections by name, start typing in the search field that says **Filter collections**. Macrometa begins to filter the list as soon as you start typing.

### Filter Collections by Type

To filter collections by type, click one of the collection types next to **All**. Macrometa displays only collections matching the selected type.

## New Collection

When viewing your collections, you can click **New Collection** to create a new collection. For full instructions, refer to the following topics:
