Integrations allow you to import data into Macrometa Global Data Network (GDN) from external data sources or other Macrometa collections. You can also export data from Macrometa GDN into external data sources or other Macrometa collections.

Once created, you can reuse integrations as many times as necessary.

## Source and Target Integrations

_Source integrations_ allow you to use an external data source or a Macrometa collection as the originating source for data. Any records entered in the source are sent to a Macrometa collection that you choose.

_Target integrations_ allow you to send data from a Macrometa collection to an external data source or a Macrometa collection. Any records entered in the collection are sent to the target that you choose.

## Transformations and Roll-ups



## Limitations

Here are some limitations that you should keep in mind as you work with collections and integrations:

- You cannot change a source integration assigned to a collection after the collection is created.
- You cannot change an integration name.
- An empty collection cannot be a target for an integration.
- - Cannot query collection immediately when it is performing bulk ingest (ask SME)
- - Update tier limits with integration limits (confirm what they are with SME)
- - Cannot edit transformations (test)
