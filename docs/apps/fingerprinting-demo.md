This demo app implements the PhotonIQ Fingerprint Service (FPS) to track site users. It identifies unauthenticated site visitors, even when they switch tabs or clear browsing data.

## Demo Site

To start exploring this demo, navigate to the [Macrometa FPS interface](https://demo.photoniq.macrometa.io/api/ds/ui/) page. You can view your digital signature, see your visits, and view attributes for each of your visits

You can open another tab, or another browser, and repeat the process. Notice how the system is able to track your visits even if you use incognito mode or switch browsers.
