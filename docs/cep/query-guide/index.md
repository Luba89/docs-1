Macrometa Stream QL is designed to process streams of events. It can be used to implement streaming data integration, streaming analytics, rule based and adaptive decision making use cases. It is an evolution of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Stream Processing systems, hence it can also be used to process stateful computations, detecting of complex event patterns, and sending notifications in real-time.

Stream QL uses SQL-like syntax, and annotations to consume events from diverse event sources with various data formats, process them using stateful and stateless operators, and send outputs to multiple endpoints according to their accepted event formats. It also supports exposing rule based and adaptive decision making as service endpoints so that external programs and systems can synchronously get decision support from streams.  

The following sections explains how to write processing logic for stream workers using Stream QL.
