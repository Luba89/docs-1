---

Ad hoc queries provide a way of performing ad-hoc operations on tables (stores or collections), named windows, and named aggregations. You can send ad hoc queries and fetch data from stores and named windows.

## Syntax

Ad hoc queries use the following syntax:

```js
	select * from SampleAdhocQueryInputTableOneMinTimeWindow;
	
	SELECT * FROM SampleAdhocQueryTable;
```
