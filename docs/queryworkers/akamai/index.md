You can use Akamai Edge Workers to publish data to pipelines. You can continuously send data to an Edge Worker, which then can publish the data to a pipeline, a Macrometa stream, or both.

Edge workers allow you to use JavaScript to preprocess or post-process data published to pipelines.

Edge workers allow you to query data inside streams and stream workers in real time.
