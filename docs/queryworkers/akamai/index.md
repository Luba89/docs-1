Akamai Edge Workers enable developers to create and deploy microservices across more than a quarter of a million edge servers deployed around the globe. Akamai has a vast content delivery network that extends Macrometa's points of presence worldwide. We allow users to build stateful applications across Akamai's network.

You can use Akamai Edge Workers to publish data to pipelines. You can continuously send data to an Edge Worker, which then can publish the data to a pipeline, a Macrometa stream, or both.

Edge workers allow you to use JavaScript to preprocess or post-process data published to pipelines. Additionally, you can query data inside streams and stream workers in real time.
