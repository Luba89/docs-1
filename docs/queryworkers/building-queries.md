This page explains how to enter a query in Macrometa. To learn more about what you can do with queries and the language for writing them, refer to [C8 Query Language](c8ql/../index.md).

## Query Builder

To write a query, log in to Macromenta and then navigate to the QUERIES section. Enter queries in the Query Builder on the Editor tab, starting with line 1.

## Bind Parameters

[Bind parameters](fundamentals.md#bind-parameters), created with the '@' symbol, display fields for the corresponding Key and Value on the right-hand side. You can use this to pass values to your query or query worker in the Query Builder.

## Syntax Helper

Macrometa has a built-in tool to help you with C8QL syntax. Click **Syntax**, then start typing to see a list of available options.

In the screenshot below, the user typed **in**.

## Next Steps

After you write a query, you can do the following:
- [Run the query.](running-queries.md)
- Save the query as a [Query Worker](query-workers.md).
