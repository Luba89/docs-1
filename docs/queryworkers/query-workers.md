You can create and update query workers with the GDN console or by using the REST API. Each Query Worker is tied to a specific query text and parameter set. You can set optional or mandatory default values for query parameters.

Each Query Worker is protected and exposed as its own endpoint. Query Workers are organized by fabric (or database) so you can have query workers for different geo-regions or fabrics within same region.
